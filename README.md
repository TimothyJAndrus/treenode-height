# Tree Height (Asynchronous)

## Overview

The goal of this exercise is to test your understanding of a simple tree
data structure and methods for traversing and analyzing trees.
To make the problem a little more challenging, the provided `TreeNode`
implementation provides only an asynchronous function for fetching
children of a `TreeNode`. The `getChildrenAsync()` of `TreeNode` returns
a promise that is resolved after a random time period.
